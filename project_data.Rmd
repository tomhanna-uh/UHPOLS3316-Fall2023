## Discussion: Your Project Data Set

Discussion: Project data set

        1. Keep it simple 
        
                a. Fewer variables and fewer observations are better
                b. You don't need to solve the problem in this class 
                c. Try to avoid time series - or be aware of the issues

	
        2. Types of variables
        
                a. Look for: Numbers with decimal places (Continuous variables)
                b. Avoid: binary (0/1, yes/no, on/off)
                c. Avoid: Words - Categorical Variables
                d. Avoid: Ordered numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd) - Ordinal Variables
                + e. Avoid: Numbers without decimal places (Discrete variables)

        3. Sources if you don't have something in mind

                a. Internal R datasets - https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html
                b. The Dataverse - https://dataverse.org/ , Example https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2665963821000762
                c. State and federal databases, Example: https://cris.dot.state.tx.us/public/Query/app/home
                d. Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
