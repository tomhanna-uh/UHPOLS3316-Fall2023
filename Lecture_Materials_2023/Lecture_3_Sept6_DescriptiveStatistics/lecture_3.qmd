## Descriptive Statistics

## Why do we use descriptive statistics?

- Explore the data
- See patterns in the data
- Communicate about the data

## What are the most basic things we need to know?

- What is the scope of the data (time, geography, cases)?
- What are the variables?
- What is the unit of observation?

##

**Example**

"This data set provides information on the fate of passengers on the fatal maiden voyage of the ocean liner ‘Titanic’, summarized according to economic status (class), sex, age and survival."

```{r}

titanic_data <- as.data.frame(Titanic)

head(titanic_data)

```
This data is formatted the way we typically like to use data:

- units of observation: rows
- variables: columns

##

**BEWARE! Not all data is formatted this way!** Sometimes you have to think "is this a variable or a unit of observation?"

For example data is often presented with variables as rows and units of observation as columns. That's the easy case.

Sometimes, we get data in a mixed format called *wide format*. For example, the following data on Scandinavian temperatures:

```{r}
# From https://sejdemyr.github.io/r-tutorials/basics/wide-and-long/
# created by SIMON EJDEMYR

# Create long dataset
country_long <- data.frame(
    expand.grid(country = c("Sweden", "Denmark", "Norway"), year = 1994:1996),
    avgtemp = round(runif(9, 3, 12), 0)
    )

# Create wide dataset
country_wide <- data.frame(
    country = c("Sweden", "Denmark", "Norway"),
    avgtemp.1994 = country_long$avgtemp[1:3],
    avgtemp.1995 = country_long$avgtemp[4:6],
    avgtemp.1996 = country_long$avgtemp[7:9])
country_wide 

```

It looks like the unit of observation is country and the variable is a combination of year and temperature. 

##

If we look at it in the long format we are used to, it's a little clearer:

```{r}

country_long

```


The variable is average temperature. 

The unit of observation is actually not country - it's country-year. Sweden-1994 is one observation, Sweden-1995 is a different observation, and Sweden-1996 is a different observation all with different temperature values. 


## Measures of Central Tendency

Measures of central tendency help us:

- reveal patterns
- find the typical measurement
- find the center

## Measures of Central Tendence

**A few numbers that can summarize the center of measurement**

- Mean

- Median

- Mode

## Mean

- Symbol: $\bar{x}$
- Not the middle value
- Not the most common
- The center of mass - the sum above equals the sum below
- Formula is $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum X_i}{n}$
- Read that: The mean of X equals the sum of the observations (i) of X divided by the number (n) of observations. 

## Example A:

A. What is the mean of 1,5,7,9,10,12,18

## Example A:

A. What is the mean of 1,5,7,9,10,12,18


```{r}

A <- c(1,5,7,9,10,12,18)

answer_a1 <- (sum(A)/7)

answer_a2 <- mean(A)

answer_a1
answer_a2

```

## Example B

B. What is the mean of 10,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55

## Example B

B. What is the mean of 10,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55


```{r}
B <- c(10,20,30,35,40,45,50,55,25)

mean_b1 <- (sum(B)/9)

mean_b2 <- mean(B)

mean_b1
mean_b2
```

## Median

 - Midpoint
 - Half observations are greater, half are lower
 - Just count
 - Even observations - midpoint between middle two
 
## Example A
 
 A - 1,5,7,9,10,12,18
 
## Example A
 
 A - 1,5,7,9,10,12,18

```{r}
median(A)

```

## Example B

 B - 10,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55
 
 
## Example B

 B - 10,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55
 
```{r}
median(B)
```
## Keep in mind for later
In both of our examples, the mean and median were close but not the same. That isn't always the case. 

## Mode

- Most common value
- Just count

## Examples:

C. 1,2,3,4,4,5,6,7

Answer: 

D. 10,20,30,30,40,40,40,50,50,60,70

Answer:



## Advantages and disadvantages

- Median isn't affected by outliers

- Mean gives the broader picture because it includes the outliers.

- Mode is the only option for categorical variables. 

- *We will discuss types of variables more later in the semester when we talk about hypothesis testing. I will also post more information on this later this week.*



## Skewed distribution - when mean and median are different

**The three numbers are often different for the same sample or population.**

Example:
